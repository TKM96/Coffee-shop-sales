The analysis I performed on historical Bright Coffee dataset to get insights about the performance, sales trends,peak times of day, revenue, best and worst sellers, factors affecting consumption and 
recommendations to help the CEO improve the business performance.

Tools used:
  SNOWFLAKE SQL to group data into 30 minute intervals, Days, Months all into separate columns. I created an additional column to get total amount per transaction.
  EXCEL pivot tables and graphs for visualisation.
  CANVA for presenting the findings.
